What is there to know about starting to hike? Slip into your comfiest shoes,
step out the door, and off you go for a leisurely stroll. Sure, it's a
simple, delightful way to start. Yet, if you yearn for something more
adventurous — a day spent wandering through nature off the beaten path,
guiding yourself or leading your family and friends to that amazing view,
exploring unfamiliar terrains — the journey could however feel a bit more
challenging and perhaps even overwhelming. Let's explore how to wipe these
challenges off the table and get ourselves organized for an unforgettable
outdoor experience.

## Finding the perfect trail

Obviously, the journey to a pleasant hike starts with finding the right trail.
The classic approach is going through guides or [books about the region](https://www.lannoo.be/nl/groot-wandelboek-ardennen-2)
that piques your interest and select one which suits you. While traditional
maps and guidebooks are useful for finding and navigating [marked](https://thruhiker.co/hiking-blazes-trail-markings/)
routes, it's important to be aware whether they're still up to date. This is
especially true for lesser-known paths in less touristic areas. Maintaining
trails and their blazes costs tax-payers money so depending on the region
your mileage might vary. Speaking from personal experience, I've walked
routes from guidebooks that were outdated or had poorly maintained markers,
leading to a bit of frustration. Having to backtrack and figure things out is
part of the adventure, but it can also lead to lost time and detract from a
smooth, enjoyable hiking experience.

Don't get me wrong, traditional paper resources like maps and guidebooks are
invaluable for hiking! Yet, when it comes to picking the ideal hike, I've
found navigation apps like [Alltrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) and
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) to be incredibly helpful. These apps offer
the flexibility to search and select tours based on a variety of preferences,
such as region, trail length, circular or not, difficulty level, terrain
type, and scenic choices like riverside walks or forest treks. Moreover, and
perhaps more importantly, these apps allow you to access reviews and ratings
from fellow hikers. This feedback is a fantastic resource, helping you make a
well-informed choice for your next great adventure without the need to
improvise on the spot.

### Circular or not

It may be obvious, but it's good to remember that hikes can either be circular
or point-to-point (another property you can choose when searching online).
With a circular hike, you end up where you began, which is convenient if
you're parking your car near the starting point. An added plus of circular
trails is the flexibility in choosing where to start. You can begin at any
point along the loop, making it easier to locate a suitable parking spot.

Choosing a non-circular hike means you'll need to think a bit more about
transportation if you need to return to your starting point. Using public
transport can introduce the need to keep an eye on the clock, which might add
a bit of stress to your outing. If you're hiking with a group and have access
to more than one car, a practical solution is to carpool to the end point and
then take one car back to the start. This approach requires some planning but
can make your hike more seamless and enjoyable.

### Total elevation meters

When planning your hike, it's crucial to consider both your physical limits
and those of your companions. The total distance of the hike is an important
factor, but often, the
[elevation gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_elevation_gain) –
the total height you'll ascend and descend during your hike – plays a more
significant role. It's essential not to underestimate this aspect or
overestimate your abilities. Both climbing and descending can be physically
challenging. For example, a 14km hike might seem manageable, but it can be
quite strenuous if it includes a [+600m elevation gain](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/belgium/luxembourg/rochehaut-les-echelles-et-cretes-de-frahan).
Being realistic about what you can handle ensures a more enjoyable and safe
hiking experience.

Regarding elevation gain, it can be helpful to understand contour lines on a
[topographic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map).
While many navigation apps provide a 2D view of the climbs and descents for a
chosen trail, knowing how to read these lines is beneficial. This skill
allows you to make informed decisions, especially if you need to stray from
the marked path during your hike.

## Navigating

We already mentioned navigation apps like [Alltrails](https://www.alltrails.com/)
and [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) to select a trail. As you might have
expected, you can also use them to navigate your hike by phone. This is super
useful as it makes navigating the terrain pretty much a no-brainer. For these
apps to be meaningful and featureful you will probably have to shell out a
little bit of money to unlock all of their features.

### Offline maps

While hiking, you may notice that cellphone reception varies depending on your
location. In more remote areas, it's common to experience poor or even no
reception at all. That's why it's essential to ensure you can download your
trail map onto your phone in advance, so you do not rely on connectivity to
navigate (GPS itself does not need cell/data reception). If your chosen
hiking app offers [offline maps](https://support.komoot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023078891-Using-komoot-offline)
as a premium feature, consider investing in it. Relying solely on reception
for map access is not advisable. Instead, take the time to download your map
well before your hike, and avoid doing it at the last minute.

### Battery life

When you're out on the trail, the last thing you want is for your phone to run
out of battery. To ensure you stay connected and powered up during your hike,
it's a good idea to close all those battery-draining apps and features like
Bluetooth, wireless, and cellular data (offline maps remember). In addition,
bring along an external battery pack to keep your phone charged, and don't
forget to pack a charging cable to connect your phone.

## Hiking alone

Embarking on a hike together with kindred spirits can be truly satisfying.
Experiencing together the beauty nature has to offer, sharing the satisfying
effort of the journey and achievement creates and deepens a bond. There is
however nothing wrong embarking on a solo trip. On the contrary. Being alone
on a journey can be very fulfilling, healing and improve your
self-confidence. In such cases, prioritizing safety is essential. Sharing the
details of your journey beforehand with a trusted contact is necessary to
ensure someone knows your whereabouts in case of an emergency.  Details such
as the start, finish, the location of your car, in which direction you plan
to start and agreeing on a phone call or message when finishing are useful.

Additionally, navigation apps such as
[Komoot](https://support.komoot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057712031-Live-Tracking-Share-your-live-location),
have the ability to share in real-time your location (though it requires a
data connection). Remember, safety should always be a top priority when
exploring the outdoors.

## Carrying babies, infants or toddlers

Bringing your little one along for a hike using a
[backpack carrier](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=backpack+carrier+hiking&t=newext&atb=v405-1&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
is a wonderful experience. Introducing your children to the joys of nature at
an early age can be immensely rewarding and might even ignite a lifelong
passion for hiking. I've personally found that the gentle rhythm of walking
and the tranquil forest views, sounds and air can have an incredibly calming
effect on your child.

Now, if you're planning to hit the trails with a slightly older and
consequently heavier child to cary, it can present a bit more of a challenge.
It's essential to become acquainted with the ins and outs of using a backpack
carrier and make some trial hikes before embarking on your actual adventure.
Depending on the weight you'll be carrying, those extra kilos can put a
strain on your physical endurance, especially your knees during downhill
stretches.  Keep that in mind when selecting your hike.  In this case, a
walking stick can provide a welcome support during descends.

When it comes to hiking with children, one aspect that deserves special
consideration is the weather conditions. Hot or cold conditions you're not
used to, should be avoided. It's not because you're doing the walking and are
thirsty that the little one on your back does not need to drink; keeping your
little one well-hydrated is obviously important to keep an eye on.
Additionally, don't forget to pack essential items like sunscreen and
mosquito repellent, regardless of the weather conditions.

The fragility of children demands extra care and good preparation. Hiking
should never involve taking unnecessary risks, especially when our little
ones are along for the adventure. Furthermore, it's a wise choice to steer
clear of trails that are labeled as difficult or challenging ensuring a
smooth, enjoyable, and, most importantly, safe hiking experience for the
entire family.

## Closing thoughts

If you ever had the desire to go out on a hiking trip in nature, off the
beaten path, but never came around doing so then I can only hope that these
words inspired you to plan your upcoming trip and discover that it can be a
truly enriching experience of connecting with nature and gain a deeper
appreciation for the world around us.

and remember:  "Not all those who wander are lost"


Happy trails ahead!
