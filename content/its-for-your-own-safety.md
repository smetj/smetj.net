### An unexpected near-miss

Recently, while driving on a provincial road in Belgium I use daily, I
approached a long, slow curve. At the start of the curve, a broken white line
indicated no parking on the roadside. Yet, halfway through the bend, a car
was parked partly in my lane. Seeing no oncoming traffic, I gently crossed
the broken white line to pass around the parked car — without using my
indicators.

As I crossed the line, the car’s emergency lane-keeping system forcefully
jerked the steering wheel back towards the parked car, sending me straight
toward a collision. This triggered the car’s own collision warning, forcing
me to counter-steer quickly to avoid hitting the parked vehicle at around 65
km/h.

If someone had stepped out from behind that parked car, there would have been
zero margin left. Just think about that for a moment.

### Emergency lane-keeping systems (ELK): what are they?

[Emergency lane-keeping systems](https://www.bmv.de/SharedDocs/EN/Articles/StV/Roadtraffic/new-vehicle-safety-systems.html)
(ELK) became mandatory on all new EU cars as of 2022 [^1]. These systems aim
to prevent crashes caused by drifting into another lane due to drowsiness or
distraction.

My car uses a feature called “Lane Departure Warning” with three selectable
modes. According to the manual (since the car’s user interface does not fully
explain them), these modes behave as follows:

- Expanded: warns and actively intervenes whenever the vehicle is about to
  cross a lane marking, regardless of context.
- In Dangerous Situations: intervenes only if it detects the crossing is
  unintended or senses oncoming traffic.
- Off: disables all active interventions.

From the naming on the interface alone, it’s reasonable to assume a warning
system would merely alert the driver and not actively steer. However, the
manual clarifies that these modes can include quite forceful steering
corrections — a detail you’d easily overlook without reading it carefully.

### Contradictions and frustrations

After the near-miss, I carefully documented what had happened — including
photographs of the location and a detailed description of the system’s
behavior — and reported it to my local dealership. I offered any data or
follow-up they might need to assess the dangerous intervention.

The dealership eventually closed my case, arguing the system worked within its
specifications and that I should have used my indicators to tell the system I
intended to cross the center line. They did not consider the intervention
dangerous, despite their own collision warning activating as a result.

That seems deeply contradictory: if a steering intervention causes a collision
warning, doesn’t that suggest the intervention itself is unsafe?


### Final thoughts

Reflecting on this experience, I’m left with uneasy questions:

- If a system can trigger a collision warning because of its own steering
  input, is it truly improving safety?

- Despite having camera and radar sensors, the system seems remarkably crude,
  following rules that satisfy regulations but don’t necessarily protect real
  people on real roads.

- The software updates I’ve seen mention vague “improvements” to lane
  departure systems but give no details, which hardly builds confidence.

- If an accident does occur because of a steering intervention, what is the
  driver’s legal standing? Most likely, the burden still falls on the driver,
  leaving you with little recourse against the manufacturer.

These systems, while well-intentioned, risk creating new types of danger when
they overrule driver judgment. It raises critical questions for carmakers,
regulators, and drivers alike.

If you’ve had a similar experience with emergency lane-keeping systems or
other driver-assist technologies, I encourage you to share it — only through
awareness and discussion can these tools evolve to truly protect us rather
than put us in harm’s way.
